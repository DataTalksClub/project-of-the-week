## DIY Recommendation Systems (Part 2)

* **Goal**: After learning about the different types of recommendation system algorithms during week 1, now we compare the two algorithms we explored. Also, we create a more advanced version of a recommendation system using a hybrid approach.
* **Dates**: from 16th to 23rd November.
* **Where:** [`#project-of-the-week`](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C02BP4FQH36) in DataTalks.Club (get in slack here: [https://datatalks.club/slack.html](https://datatalks.club/slack.html))
