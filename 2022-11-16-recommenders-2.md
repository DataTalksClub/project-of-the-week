## DIY Recommendation Systems (Part 2)

* **Goal**: After learning about the different types of recommendation system algorithms during [Part 1](2022-10-19-recommenders-1.md), now we compare the two algorithms we explored. Also, we create a more advanced version of a recommendation system using a hybrid approach.
* **Dates**: from 16th to 23rd November.
* **Where:** [`#project-of-the-week`](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C02BP4FQH36) in DataTalks.Club (get in slack here: [https://datatalks.club/slack.html](https://datatalks.club/slack.html))

## Technologies 

* Scikit-Learn
* [LightFM](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm)
* Jupyter notebooks


Note: this is a suggested list of technologies, you can chose
alternatives instead

## Plan

This is a proposed plan only, you don’t have to follow it day-by-day.


### Day 0 (16 November, Wednesday)

* Recap of the project you work on during [Part 1](2022-10-19-recommenders-1.md) of this project-of-the-week.
* If you couldn’t work on Part 1 of this project-of-the-week, then you can catch up by quickly reviewing some of the suggested materials.
* Create a GitHub project
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media

Suggested materials

* 💻 [Sample project](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/product-recommendation) for [Part 1](2022-10-19-recommenders-1.md).

Would you like to add your project for Part 1? Create a PR with links!


### Day 1 (17 November, Thursday)

* Learn about evaluation metrics for recommender systems.
  * Check which metrics are available
  * Learn more about average precision and MAP.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

**Tip:** You may find useful to have a baseline solution (e.g. sorting by frequency) and try to evaluate it.

* 📺 [Week 6: Recommender Systems - Part 4: Evaluation of Recommender Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpv8iMe24-Q)


### Day 2 (18 November, Friday)

* Continue learning about evaluation metrics for recommender systems.
  * Map@k and Mar@k
  * Coverage
  * Novelty
  * Personalization
  * MSE and RMSE
  * ROC and AUC
* Decide which metrics you will consider for comparing the recommender systems you created.
* Commit your changes
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media

### Day 3 (19 November, Saturday)

* Compare the recommender systems you created (Content based and Collaborative filtering) using the metrics that you selected.
* Come up with a conclusion why both recommender systems are different and write about it.
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

**Note:** If you didn't have the chance to work on the project, have a look at projects from [Part 1](2022-10-19-recommenders-1.md).

### Day 4 (20 November, Sunday)

* Continue exploring more about this topic.
* Polish the documentation for your project.
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.
* Give us feedback.
* Add the link to your project to this project of the week GitHub page.
