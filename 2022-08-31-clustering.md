# DIY Clustering algorithms and models

* **Goal:** learn about different types of clustering algorithms and use them in datasets in notebooks.
* **Dates:** from 31 August to 6 September 
* **Where:** [`#project-of-the-week`](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C02BP4FQH36) in DataTalks.Club (get in slack here: [https://datatalks.club/slack.html](https://datatalks.club/slack.html))


For more information about the "Project of the Week" initiative
at DataTalks.Club, see [README.md](README.md).
