## DIY Data Version Control (DVC)

* **Goal**:Learn how to use DVC as a tool for versioning data, pipeline managing, experimentation, and many other usages. Get practical experience by using it for your project.

* **Dates**: from 22th May to 28th May.
* **Where:** [`#project-of-the-week`](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C02BP4FQH36) in DataTalks.Club (get in slack here: [https://datatalks.club/slack.html](https://datatalks.club/slack.html))

For more information about the "Project of the Week" initiative
at DataTalks.Club, see [README.md](README.md).

alternatives instead

## Plan

This is a proposed plan only, you don’t have to follow it day-by-day.

### Day 1 (22 May, Wednesday)

* Create a GitHub repository.
* Install DVC in your own OS with [2]
* Understand and run Data version control capabilities (with custom data for example txt or csv) check out [1] and [3]. **Friendly reminder**: DVC is not just a version control tool it also contains experimentation, pipelines, and more.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

Suggested material:

1. 🗒️[Why and When to use DVC?](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases)
2. 🗒️[Official Doc for installation](https://dvc.org/doc/install)
3. 📺[Hands-on with DVC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efnw2QvlhZM)

### Day 2 (23 May, Thursday)

* Create an ML project pipeline that contains a processing, training, and evaluation step. For dataset ideas check the first link in the suggested materials [1]. I would suggest using small datasets and light libraries (sklearn and datasets) remember, the goal is to explore/learn the tool.
* For ideas on how to split your ML pipeline, you can check the official example: [2]. I made also a simple ml pipeline with a random forest with iris data if you want to copy: [3]
* Create a params.yml that is going to store important parameters for the processing and training steps of your ML pipeline. Check these examples: Official example [4], mine more simple example [5]
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

**Notice** the pipelines.py scripts do not have any dependency on DVClibrary (only the evaluation part, so you can skip it for now).

5. 💻 [Params.yml more simplified](https://github.com/AntonisCSt/POW_DVC/blob/main/params.yaml)

### Day 3 (24 May, Friday)

* Finish preparing your own project if you haven’t from the previous day
* Perform a version of your dataset with DVC: [1],[2]
* For configuring the storage you can check [3].
 In case you don’t want to spend time setting a remote storage, you can also use a local folder.
* Play with dvc commands `dvc status`,`dvc add`, `dvc add` (also with your git commands)
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

### Day 4 (25 May, Saturday)

* Try to build pipelines based on the official documentation [1]
* You can follow the official video tutorial [2]. The video is from 3 years ago and some commands might have changed so make sure you use [1] docs in parallel.
* Check out the summary in [3] to understand what this DVC feature solves.
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

**Note:** It is important to have your params.yml ready and the dependencies correct in `dvc stage add` flags.
Post your `dvc dag` if you want 🙂

### Day 5 (26 May, Sunday)

* Create an evaluation.py script that prints and plots metrics from your ML model.
* Install DVClive and adapt the library functions to your script like the official tutorial: [1].
* Check out the official hands-on tutorial: [2]
* Compare the git committed code with the local changes (in terms of params, metrics, and plots)
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

Note: It is important to have your params.yml ready and the dependencies correct in `dvc stage add` flags. 
Post your `dvc dag` if you want 🙂

* Run and compare different experiments using [2]
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media
