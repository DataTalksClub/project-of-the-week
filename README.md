## Learning in public

Most people learn in private: they consume content but don't tell
anyone about it. There's nothing bad in it.

But we want to encourage you to document your progress and
share it publicly on social media.

It helps you get noticed and will lead to: 

* Expanding your network: meeting new people and making new friends
* Being invited to meetups, conferences and podcasts
* Landing a job or getting clients
* Many other good things
