## DIY Recommendation Systems

* **Goal**: Learn about the different types of recommendation system algorithms and explore them in Jupyter notebooks. 
* **Dates**: from 19 October to 2 November
* **Where:** [`#project-of-the-week`](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C02BP4FQH36) in DataTalks.Club (get in slack here: [https://datatalks.club/slack.html](https://datatalks.club/slack.html))
