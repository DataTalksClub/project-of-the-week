## DIY FastAPI

* **Goal**: Learn about FastAPI to create an API that serves a Machine Learning model.
* **Dates**: from 7th to 13th December.
* **Where:** [`#project-of-the-week`](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C02BP4FQH36) in DataTalks.Club (get in slack here: [https://datatalks.club/slack.html](https://datatalks.club/slack.html))

For more information about the "Project of the Week" initiative

## Technologies 

* FastAPI
* Scikit-Learn
* Tensorflow
* Pytorch


Note: this is a suggested list of technologies, you can chose
alternatives instead

## Plan

This is a proposed plan only, you don‚Äôt have to follow it day-by-day.


### Day 1 (7 December, Wednesday)

* Come up with a project idea 
* Select the dataset for your project. You can select a dataset from the suggested material below.
* Create a GitHub repository.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

Suggestions:
You can use a Machine Learning model that you might have created before or another project that you like: 
* During a previous project-of-the-week:
  * [Frontend for your ML model](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/project-of-the-week/blob/main/2022-08-14-frontend.md)
  * [Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/project-of-the-week/blob/main/2022-10-19-recommenders-1.md)
* An example of a [Churn model](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp/05-deployment/code).
* A [list of some datasets](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_7_project/datasets.md) that you can use for the project.
* Have a look at [this sample project](https://github.com/lilianabs/fastapi-car-price-pred).

### Day 2 (8 December, Thursday)

* Perform exploratory data analysis of your data in a Jupyter notebook.
* If you are using a previous project, then try to improve the model (or move on to Day 4).
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

### Day 3 (9 December, Friday)

* Create a baseline model and save it as a `.pkl` file.
* Start studying some introductory material about FastAPI.
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

### Day 4 (10 December, Saturday)

* Continue learning about FastAPI
* Create a simple working example of an API:
   * Code along with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RS9W8MtZe4).
* Test your API using the interactive API documentation that [FastAPI creates automatically with Swagger](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/#interactive-api-docs).
* (Optional) Write a Python script to test your API.
* (Optional) Test your API using curl or Postman.
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

### Day 5 (11 December, Sunday)

* Create a new endpoint to serve the model you created (use the `.pkl` file you created on Day 3).
* Test your API using the interactive API documentation that [FastAPI creates automatically with Swagger](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/#interactive-api-docs).
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.
