## Plan

This is a proposed plan only, you don’t have to follow it day-by-day.

* Pull a basic image and test some basic commands of Docker command line: [Docker commands in the command line](https://medium.com/edureka/docker-commands-29f7551498a8)
* Create your own `hello world` Dockerfile, create an image from it and run a container: [ Hello world with Docker](https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/devops/basic-docker-commands), [Hello world with Docker](https://www.codewithjason.com/docker-hello-world-app/)
* Learn basic Docker commands and test them arround with the dockerfile: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

### Day 3 (20 October, Friday)

* Choose a project on your own, you can create a simple prediction model or an analysis. Choose a dataset from this link: [list of some datasets](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_7_project/datasets.md)
* Create a script that prints information about this dataset. (for exampe df.describe) or that makes a prediction.
* Create a Dockerfile with a light python image that prints the same result after running the container.
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

### Day 4 (21 October, Saturday)

* Create an API for your project. It can be a simple get reques with a simple message or a post request for your model prediciton. If you dont have much time to prepare your own API in python check these examples and the required commands from this repo: [prediction_service.py](https://github.com/AntonisCSt/Docker_POW/blob/main/simple_FastAPI_prediction/prediction_service.py)
* You can also create a frontend server with streamlit.
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.

### Day 5 (22 October, Sunday)

* Create a Dockerfile that contains commands to run the API. Use a light python image as a base. See the suggestions below depending on the tool you used yesterday.
* Run the container and test your API endpoint. (make sure you have exposed the port of the container).
* Push your changes to GitHub.
* Share your progress in Slack and on social media.
